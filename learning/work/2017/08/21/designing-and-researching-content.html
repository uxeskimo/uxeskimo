We’re also recording search queries on the prototype so this combined with the findings from the card sort has allowed the content designers to propose an initial stab at what the categories should be.</p> <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/card-sort-findings.jpg" alt="Card sort findings"/></p> <p>Armed with the new categories today I redesigned the prototype home page, now that we have more content available I felt that the search facility became more pertinent, I’ve decided on the home page to make this more prominent to encourage the user to use it.</p> <p>I’m a strong believer in that the best designs are simple - that is a highlight of working for the Co-op, the brands encourages simplicity so you have the perfect playground.</p> <p>With simplicity in mind, I’ve designed two versions of the home page with links to the current proposed categories, one version has additional text about the category which might help users understand the content of the categories more.</p> <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/prototype-one.jpg" alt="Prototype screen"/></p> <p>In my mind the design should make it easy to find procedures and when found be presented in a way that’s most appropriate to the task, so the user understands the information however it is presented.</p> <p>Well good day of design work, we will get the prototypes in store this week, I’ll let you know how we get on and what we learn.</p> <p>Hope this makes sense, I’ve written most of it on the tram home with <a href="http://www.uxeskimo.co.uk/learning/writing/2017/08/16/ulysses-simplicity.html">Ulysses</a>.</p> <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/prototype-two.jpg" alt="Prototype screen two"/></p> </article> </section> </div> </div> </div> </main> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="row"> <div class="column medium-6"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="07545351167">07545351167</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:uxeskimo@gmail.com">uxeskimo@gmail.com</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a></li> </ul> <p>A mancunian production, copyright © 2017 Lee Murray</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/scripts/script.js"></script> </body> </html>
