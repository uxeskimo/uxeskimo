<h1 class="title">Trying to make things simple</h1>

<p>My thing is designing digital products armed with the skillsets required of the modern designer.</p>

<p>I've been doing this a while now and along my journey have helped The Citizens Advice Bureau, N Brown Group PLC, Sigma and many other businesses.</p>

<p>My other passions include sport, I enjoy running, football, riding my bike and putting my feet up to watch a good film or read a book.</p>

<p>I've recently qualified as an amateur boxing coach and am passionate about the part that boxing and mentoring can play in young peoples lives.</p>

<p>To quickly try to describe myself I'd say I'm an open, honest person who has a good work ethic and someone that is always curious about design. I think its important that everyoneâ€™s voice in a room is heard and try to encourage environments where this happens.</p>

<p>I enjoy working collaboratively as part of a team, sharing ideas and constantly trying to improve designs for the best user experience.</p>
