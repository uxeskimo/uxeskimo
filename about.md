<h1 class="title">I'm a family man...</h1>

<p>First off I'm a proud husband and father who loves to design interfaces, build them <strong>in the browser</strong> and test them, all based on <strong>user needs</strong>.</p>

<p>I've been doing this a while now and along my journey have helped The Citizens Advice Bureau, N Brown Group PLC, Sigma and many other business.</p>

<p>My other passions include sport, I enjoy running, football, riding my bike and watching films.</p>

<p>I'm a quiet, reliable and determined guy who works hard and produces the goods when it matters.</p>

<p>I enjoy working collaboratively as part of a team, sharing ideas and constantly trying to improve designs for the best <strong>user experience</strong>.</p>
