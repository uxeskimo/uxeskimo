<h3 class="border-title">About</h3>
<h1 class="title">Trying to make things simple.</h1>

<p>My thing is designing digital products armed with the skillsets required of the modern designer.</p>

<p>I've been doing this a while now and along my journey have helped The Citizens Advice Bureau, N Brown Group PLC, Sigma and many other business.</p>

<p>My other passions include sport, I enjoy running, football, riding my bike and watching films.</p>

<p>I've recently qualified as an amateur boxing coach and am passionate about the part that boxing and mentoring can play in young peoples lives.</p>

<p>I'm a quiet, reliable and determined guy who works hard and produces the goods when it matters.</p>
