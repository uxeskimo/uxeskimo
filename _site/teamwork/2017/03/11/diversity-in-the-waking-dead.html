                   <p>I’d heard a lot of noise about ‘The Walking Dead’ but it didn’t grab me when it first started broadcasting, it’s only recently that I thought lets see what the fuss is about.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Fast forward and I’m near the end of season 6, I’ve really enjoyed being taken to a post apocalyptic world where only the strong survive.  What I’ve really been impressed with though is the diversity of the cast, it discriminates no one and it has set a standard other TV shows should follow.</p>

<h2 id="minorities">Minorities</h2>

<p>We have lead women, ethnic minorities, all types of relationships, which don’t follow common stereotypes, they all stand on their own merits and I’m sure the diverse group have been a big factor in the shows box office success.</p>

<p>The team have worked together to help each other survive this ruthless new word they have found themselves living in and I can’t help thinking putting this non-fictional TV show aside how the best teams I have worked in have been diverse  - different people from different backgrounds with different personalities, strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>

<p>Research backs diversity in teams but from my own experiences at the simplest level, it can help a group look at things from a different perspective.</p>

<ul class="highlight">
	<li>"A 2015 McKinsey report on 366 public companies found that those in the top quartile for ethnic and racial diversity in management were 35% more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, and those in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely to have returns above the industry mean." <span class="author-citation">David Rock and Heidi Grant <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter</a></span></li>
</ul>

<p>If businesses are looking for talent, people come to their talents in different ways.  Not everyone has had the privilege of a good education, so investing in people, training them to be an asset to the business, giving people from deprived areas a lifeline - a chance - you could find that in doing so the business is enriched by all those life experiences.</p>

<h2 id="women-in-tech">Women in tech</h2>

<p>My employer The Co-op Digital has taken a defiant stance for women in tech, refusing to speak at events or be part of panel discussions of two or more people unless there is <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2016/07/26/gender-diversity-at-conferences-events/">at least one woman speaking or part of the panel.</a></p>

<p>I’m proud that the Co-op is taking diversity seriously and I’m sure they will do more in the future and hopefully other businesses will follow suite.</p>

<p>Thats all for now, if you think I’ve used the word ‘different’ a lot it’s intentional, being different is good so lets celebrate it! Anyway I’ve got to get back to The Walking Dead, adios for now.</p>
