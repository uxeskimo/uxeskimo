From looking into Django yesterday, on to a more important topic, looking after yourself!<!--more-->


I've wanted to get fitter at the minute and managed to get into the gym at work 4 times last week which was great.  This week is not so great as I now have have a sore back, something which is common when working on computers for a living.

I've made a promise to myself that I won't use computers without the correct equipment and you should to.  From tomorrow I will now use the following with my macbook laptop:

* [Laptop stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Griffin-Elevator-Desktop-Laptops-Macbooks/dp/B0044RUSZM/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1503510951&sr=8-6&keywords=laptop+stand)
* [Wireless keyboard](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA22B/A/magic-keyboard-british-english?fnode=24a99d0a2605876683d50bd3d6d780f05e3c5054e1e8c4f283788484a4bb6db420c825180617cd595d0c6b8d69fa0bb181e55f2fae41b297b00cef984ff52569f616742c9b283d314317b0d0e39ee6c4f762a9c3cf4de498405ca740a4e4b44b)  
* [Laptop mouse](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLA02Z/A/magic-mouse-2?fnode=5c9e0345d2cd64324199a18fdae3523cffaf14363865f0edd11239a918bcf8d283a7450c707ce0f78f534c95cdd262d0a3048cb25b682271db464d3262541f8545318faa7b5967c186afdd0ad7888c616b803287cf931dbac2229d0c97c9912f)

laptops are great but have been blamed for causing work-related back, neck and shoulder problems so here's some [posture tips](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/workplacehealth/Pages/laptophealth.aspx)

I've enquired and found out that you can have someone at work come and check your chair and sitting position - this is something I will get booked in, check with your work, you should be offered the same help.

I've also looked into exercises to help people who work on computers in their job, this are good for [lower back pain](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Backpain/Pages/low-back-pain-exercises.aspx ) I've started to do them today and will now make sure it's a daily activity for me.

I've also set reminders on my macbook via google chromes [break timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/break-timer/hklkdbpicdmlpoiellngedpejjkmapei?hl=en) to alert me every 45 mins when I plan to get up and do a walk.

Getting work done is important but not as important as looking after yourself, sounds obvious doesn't it but how many of us really do?
