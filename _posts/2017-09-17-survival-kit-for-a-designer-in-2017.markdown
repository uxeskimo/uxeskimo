I’ve been designing now for over 17 years but I still at times have self doubts about how I approach my design and the work I produce on projects.
<!--more-->

Speaking to fellow designers it’s not just me and I’m conscious that my profession can sometimes fall victim of a world where on a regular basis someone tweets about a new technique or tool to design in a ‘better way’.

More so than ever designers trudge the ‘circuit’ doing talks about design, more opinions, more threads on twitter, design is a hot topic.

Design in the spotlight though is a good thing, it's an opportunity to broaden your thinking and consider things you perhaps might not of previously.  Buzzwords are part of design, the more experienced you get you realise often some of the 'new' techniques being buzzed about are already things you have been doing tweaked and repackaged as a new thing.

I do worry that starting a career in design in this new digital age must be so daunting now and it's important to help other less experienced designers, remembering we're in an industry where depression and mental health issues are staggeringly high.

It's essential to know how to utilise the tools and techniques available to you as a designer to help your client or organisation get the most out of the project -building better products and services, so here comes a selection of things I think you could consider.

First off let me tell you about the most important design skill you can bring to any project, its not talked about as much as Sketch, Marvel (great tools, more on them later) etc but still most relevant today as when I started out…

## Communication
I work in a multidisciplinary team, consisting of a delivery manager, product owner, interaction designer, researcher, content designers and engineers.  In my experience, the biggest factor to a team's success is good communication, and a designer often has a understated role in how well a team communicates.

Have you ever been in a room with your team and someone is discussing a complex problem and everyone is nodding their head agreeing, the meeting finishes and a colleague comes over to you and says "I didn’t understand that did you?"

<ul class="highlight">
<li>YOU'RE A DESIGNER, DON’T LET THAT HAPPEN!!!</li>
</ul>

When discussing complex design problems, getting the team together in front of a wall/whiteboard with marker pens, visualising what is in their head often helps ensure everyone is on the same page.

Make sure your work area walls tell a story of what you been doing on a project, it helps colleagues stay in the loop and gives an opportunity to give a different perspective.  

## Be inquisitive
Within reason, question everything, you're a problem solver and the best designers will be inquisitive, always trying to get to the root of a problem.

## Sketching
Next up sketching, one thing straight away on this - ANYONE can sketch and it's not just the role of the designer in the team to do this.  I prefer to encourage everyone to get their pens out and sketch their ideas collaboratively.

I've run workshops with teams in the past which have been successful but I personally like a team to be really informal with the sketches 'buddying' up or better still <a href="http://www.uxeskimo.co.uk/learning/design/2017/08/14/the-three-amigos.html">'three amigoing'</a>, we're all human and when we are comfortable and relaxed the better ideas come out.

## Design patterns
Does your organisation have a design manual or pattern library, if they don't maybe they could benefit from one.

Have a think if your organisation could improve its design capacity with one, if they haven't push the benefits of having one yourself.

Here's a couple to have a look at:
<ul class="link-list">
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design">GOV</a></li>
<li><a href="http://coop-design-manual.herokuapp.com/">Co op design manual</a></li>
</ul>

## Sketch
When I started out it was photoshop, most definitely now it is sketch.  The great thing about sketch is how easy it is to pick up and use.  Don't spend to much time trying to improve the fidelity of a design straight away in sketch, this should come later.

## Prototyping
It's good to have a design prototype working on mobiles, tablets and desktop browsers, having interactions working like this is more realistic.  

Prototypes are so important to research and test, you will get lots of learnings from using them and testing the experience, this can save wasted resource and money.

## HTML and CSS(in the browser)
A lot of the time I do like to design in the browser, I feel it lets me tackle design problems upfront and as I go along, it gives me a 'heads up' of what's working and what's not.

If your organisation does have a design manual or boilerplate toolkit(see earlier) these can speed up you HTML prototypes even if your HTML/CSS isn't that advanced.

I think it's beneficial to take time to learn a bit of HTML and CSS; treehouse learning and code school are great resources for this.

## Paper designs on the wall
It can be helpful to quickly sketch out pages and get them on the wall, this can help straight away to communicate ideas to the team.

## Marvel app
I use <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel app</a> for quickly linking up 'paper' prototypes and it also plays really nicely with sketch with a <a href="https://marvelapp.com/sketch/">clever plugin</a> to create high fidelity prototypes really quickly.

## Service design
I've put some design tasks typically related to service design here, service design is hot off the press, in reality it's been happening for a long time(remember though  it's good people are talking about design).

## Insight boards
I prefer to use insight boards than personas, I think having some up around where you are working (if you're allowed) can remind the team of some of the problems their trying to solve.  It's more visual and helps us think beyond technology, helping us connect to actors in product/service.

The insights boards will be a product of your research but it's also worth mentioning you should always have the approach to design for everyone.

## Value proposition
Does this thing we're building meet our users needs and expectations?

Your research findings should bring this out, make sure you're making something that's needed.

## Business model canvas
A planning tool to help the team challenge our business model.  For example Is our service/product feasible and viable? encourage each member of your team to do this, here's a <a href="https://www.creatlr.com/template/UOLHsfqGrLzugzVVttoi1e/business-model-canvas/">template</a> to fill out.

## Service blueprint and customer journey mapping
Last year on a project I was working on, a wall became my office temporarily as I created the customer journey of a product we were considering.

I started off with post its to quickly get going to discuss with team, post its allow you to move things around quickly, you can move onto higher fidelity later on.

A service blueprint looks at all the different touch points in a service, it's needed for me to help visualise complexity in a service aligning a team and stakeholders and allows them to 'zoom' in and out of a particular service area and see the big picture.

## Measuring success
Measure the performance of the customer journey, it's important to know what success looks like, take time to make hypotheses and measurements.

## Product roadmap
I find this one tricky, sometimes as past experience tells me, product owners like
to do this but designers should get involved.

Often projects can just focus on the now but it's good to have a plan, think about the future development of your product and map it out.

## Get involved in research
Get involved with as much research as you can, it's essential for a good design whether it is a product or service.  

When researching with participants, three bits of simple advice; be open, organised and document your findings.

## Get multiple mentors
When I started out I tried to 'sponge' up as much knowledge as possible from professionals I came across.  I think it's important to pick your own mentors inside and outside your organisation and they don't necessarily need to be just designers.

Having multiple points of views on your work and career path will help you grow and progress.

## Watch your health
Us designers do a lot of work sat down at computers, it's not great for our health, I'm now starting to have issues with my back from the years of using computers so take regular breaks, get plenty of exercise and if you use a laptop,  <a href="http://www.uxeskimo.co.uk/learning/work/2017/08/23/designers-look-after-yourselves.html">read this</a>.

It's not just physical health, be in touch with your mental health and don't be afraid to go and speak to a <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">professional</a> if you're struggling, it could be the best decision of your life.

## Working remotely
The ability of being able to work remotely brings benefits but sometimes you can bring work home with you and it's hard to switch off, getting the work/life balance is key. Resist the temptation to do any extra hours working from home, if you do this over a longer period of time you will be less effective and your output will be counterproductive.

## Use what works for YOU
I’ve just given you my perspective on how I design in 2017 and the things I think you could take time out to learn.   Now being mindful that this blog could turn into one of those tweets I mentioned earlier on, please take this advice…

<ul class="highlight">
<li>IF YOU HAVE A PROCESS THAT WORKS FOR YOU, KEEP USING IT</li>
</ul>

There I said it, don’t get caught between two minds BUT it is smart to try new things, try and dedicate some time in your working week to try out new stuff (your employer should let you do this).

It's good to improve yourself and taking yourself out of your comfort zone is important but only when the time is right for you.

One final thing, design and your career are not the most important things in your life, spend quality time with your family and get your priorities right, it's easily said but often not followed by us.

You are a result of your life experiences, so try and live a good one and be true to yourself.

Adios for now,

Lee.
