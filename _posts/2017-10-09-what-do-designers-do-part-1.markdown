Let me start with this, designers fail when we’re trying to solve the wrong problem.
<!--more-->

I’ll say it again,

designers fail when we’re trying to solve the wrong problem.

Apologies if that sounded a bit dramatic (I hate it when people do that) but I’m sure we’ve all been on a project where we invested time and effort on a solution to a problem that didn’t really matter, this is when we fail.

What designers are ultimately judged on is seeking out the main problems, the core issues that need fixing.

Seeking out the main problems shouldn’t be just a design thing though, if you have the right people, it’s a team game, researchers, designers, engineers, delivery managers, product owners (TEAM in capitals) .

But what is design? Let’s look at something which is hot off the press at the minute, SERVICE DESIGN, how can I explain it, (Lee think of a real life example that is easy to relate to).

OK got it, here goes…

## Looking at the wrong problem
I’ll tell you a short story that happened to me when I studied at university for my degree.

The university had an on site carpark that required the use of a pre paid token to access it, so you could park your vehicle. This token machine had been installed fairly recently and seemed to work well.

That was until staff at the university started to notice the money wasn’t tallying up correctly to the amount of tokens that were in the machines and immediately assumed that the token machine was malfunctioning.    

Maintenance were called out to fix the faulty machine, no problem here they assured the university, but how could there be no problem, they were down on the money for the number of tokens.

The ‘faulty’ car park machine went on for quite a while I was told, the money the university could of accumulated was down, maintenance were called out a few more times, different companies, one even replaced some of the parts to the machine, the ‘problem’ continued.

## A smarter approach
A lecturer (with a service design background) from the university found out about the ‘problem’ and approached it in a different way, he was intrigued to get to the bottom of it.  

He conducted interviews with staff, and found out that before the new token machines were installed, the university had car park attendants to monitor the car park.  

Because the new token machines lifted a barrier up and let one car through at a time there wasn’t a need to have the car park attendants monitoring the car park all day any more, so their hours were cut.   

Alarm bells rang, this is an area to explore, he used initiative and spoke to students he knew well, he found some interesting learnings.  Some of the car park attendants were selling a number of the tokens directly to students at a cheaper price for their own gain.  

Disgruntled at losing hours because of the new machines, when they had to empty the tokens at the end of the day and put them in the machine to pay which was in the university, they were keeping some to sell on.  

They had their own interests at heart and tinkered the system to their own benefit.

## Take a step back to look at the whole picture
I promised this story would be short, so I’ll cut it there, I’m hoping you get the moral of it though? (I’ll tell you anyway)

It can be easy to look at one aspect of a problem and get blinkered trying to fix that.  

In this example that maintenance companies came out and replaced parts of the machine, it didn’t matter if they replaced the parts to the highest spec possible, that would of been solving the wrong problem.

If you don’t understand all the parts of a service you could miss something important (THINK car park attendants).


## Get to the core of the real problems
Seeing the big picture is essential for identifying the real problems; <a href="http://www.uxeskimo.co.uk/blog/designer/2017/09/17/survival-kit-for-a-designer-in-2017.html">service blueprint and customer journey mapping</a> will help you focus on the right areas.

I don’t like the term discovery phase, it can give the wrong impression, you should always be discovering on a project, it's not just at the beginning.

I do like Dans Brown’s example from his excellent book: <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/practical-design-discovery">“Practical Design Discovery”</a> on how design can be perceived on paper compared to how it often actually is in execution:

## Prove your worth, be smart with it
I often hear that stakeholders on projects don’t get the value of teams working from user needs.   

Teams spending time and effort upfront researching and learning that could result in just a recommendation that an idea is not worth pursuing,  I get that.

Traditionally businesses want to know up front the benefits they are going to get.  To get money approved upfront without knowing the benefits at the end of it is alien to them.

We must understand the approach of working from our research and user needs can be difficult for a business to articulate sometimes.

Many businesses are focused on putting figures to a  proposed value.  

Be smart, make sure we add value to the business and gradually build from it, make sure you heavily involve the business, this can be so often underestimated, most people want to be part of a success story.

## Teams solve the right problems, not just designers
At my employer the <a href="https://twitter.com/CoopDigital">Co-op Digital</a> as part of Design mcr we’re taking part in a 2 day event to teach service design on 14th and 21st October 2017, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/design-manchester-service-design-jam-tickets-38105416326?aff=es2">get a ticket here</a>.  

But why not try this - **host workshops with colleagues** in work time, there’s so much benefit to be had from them, sharing tools and techniques makes us all better but its also a way to get the value of our approach to the wider business.

Adios for now,

Lee.
