You learn lots being a designer, I'll kick off my daily learning snippets with this, 'the three amigos' session.

<!--more-->
I work in a product team consisting of a delivery manager, product owner, engineers, content designers and interaction designers (me).  

We work from stories in 'Trello' and when there are tasks that involve the cross disciplines we have always got together to discuss the work involved from everyones' perspective.

The term ‘the three amigos’ has now been introduced for these ‘get togethers’ which we did this week on a design task.  The meeting was really productive with everyone contributing, it turned into a sketching session and at the end of the meeting everyone understood what needed to be done for the task.

Call it what you want but encouraging communication between team members is essential for a good team maybe give the 'the three amigos’ a go?
