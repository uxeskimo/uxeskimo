I've been working on a project that requires a website to display procedures and <!--more-->policies for colleagues that work in food stores.

The procedures are being re-written by our content designers so we need to ensure that when a colleague uses the website they can easily find what they're looking for.  

We designed a prototype in the browser using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), with the prototype deployed to Heroku (Heroku is great for prototypes, [check it out](https://www.heroku.com)) it allowed the team to take the prototype into stores to research improvements over the current system they use.

Re-writing the policies takes time, so I initially designed the home page as a list of links which would need to be improved as we re-wrote more policies but it allowed us to get feedback on our new content straight away.

While the content was being updated it gave us an opportunity to do a [card sort](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/improving-information-architecture-card-sorting-beginners-guide/) with colleagues which was led by our researcher to see how they would categorise and group content.  We're also recording search queries on the prototype so this combined with the findings from the card sort has allowed the content designers to propose an initial stab at what the categories should be.

Armed with the new categories today I redesigned the prototype home page, now that we have more content available I felt that the search facility became more pertinent,  I've decided on the home page to make this more prominent to encourage the user to use it.

I'm a strong believer in that the best designs are simple - that is a highlight of working for the Co-op, the brands encourages simplicity so you have the perfect playground.

With simplicity in mind, I’ve designed two versions of the home page with links to the current proposed categories, one version has additional text about the category which might help users understand the content of the categories more.

In my mind the design should make it easy to find procedures and when found be presented in a way that's most appropriate to the task, so the user understands the information however it is presented.

Well good day of design work, we will get the prototypes in store this week, I’ll let you know how we get on and what we learn.

Hope this makes sense, I've written most of it on the tram home with [Ulysses](http://www.uxeskimo.co.uk/learning/writing/2017/08/16/ulysses-simplicity.html).
