My delivery manager at work asked us (product team) if we minded doing the 16 personalise test for the<!--more--> good of the team so we understand each other better and our types of personalities.

I’d never done this before so was intrigued, off I went to the website at [https://www.16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com) and answered a series of questions and this is what my results we’re.

## I’m an adventurer  ( ISFP-A)

My [results](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/b94ed82b84de2) revealed I was classed as adventurer ‘confident individualism’, some of the traits were associated with a designer so maybe there is some truth in there.

What really stood out is that my team were all confident enough in themselves to do this for the good of the team, we’ve even printed all are results out and put them on the wall.

Taking time out to try to understand your colleagues more is a good thing to do, we're all wired differently.
