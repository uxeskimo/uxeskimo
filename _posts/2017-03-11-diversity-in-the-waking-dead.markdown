I'd heard a lot of noise about 'The walking dead' but it didn't grab me when it first started broadcasting, its only recently that I thought lets see what the fuss is about.

Fast forward and I'm near the end of season 6, I've really enjoyed being taken to a post apocalyptic world where only the strong survive.  What I've really been impressed with though is the diversity of the cast, it discriminates no one and it has set a standard others tv shows should follow.

We have lead women, ethnic minorities, gay characters which don't follow common stereotypes, they all stand on their own merits and I'm sure the diverse group have been a big factor in the shows box office success.

The team have worked together to help each other survive this ruthless new word they have found them selves living in and I can't help thinking putting this non-fictional TV show aside how the best teams I have worked in have been diverse people from different backgrounds.

Research backs diversity in teams but from my own experiences at the simplest level, it can help a group look at things from a different perspective.

If businesses are looking for talent, not everyone has had the privilege of a good education, so investing in people, training them to be an asset to the business, giving people from poorer areas a lifeline is an option.

My employee The Co-op digital has taken a defient stance for women in tech, refusing to speak at events or be part of panel discussions of two or more people unless there is <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2016/07/26/gender-diversity-at-conferences-events/">at least one woman speaking or part of the panel.</a>

Im proud that the Co-op is taking diversity seriously and I'm sure they will do more in the future and hopefully other busineeses will follow suite.

Thats all for now, I've got to get back to the walking dead, aidos for now.
