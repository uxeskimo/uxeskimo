I'd heard a lot of noise about 'The Walking Dead' but it didn't grab me when it first started broadcasting, it's only recently that I thought lets see what the fuss is about.

Fast forward and I'm near the end of season 6, I've really enjoyed being taken to a post apocalyptic world where only the strong survive.  What I've really been impressed with though is the diversity of the cast, it discriminates no one and it has set a standard other TV shows should follow.

## Minorities

We have lead women, ethnic minorities, all types of relationships, which don't follow common stereotypes, they all stand on their own merits and I'm sure the diverse group have been a big factor in the shows box office success.

The team have worked together to help each other survive this ruthless new word they have found themselves living in and I can't help thinking putting this non-fictional TV show aside how the best teams I have worked in have been diverse  - different people from different backgrounds with different personalities, strengths and weaknesses.

## Diversity

Research backs diversity in teams but from my own experiences at the simplest level, it can help a group look at things from a different perspective.   

<ul class="highlight">
	<li>"A 2015 McKinsey report on 366 public companies found that those in the top quartile for ethnic and racial diversity in management were 35% more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, and those in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely to have returns above the industry mean." <span class="author-citation">David Rock and Heidi Grant <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter</a></span></li>

If businesses are looking for talent, people come to their talents in different ways.  Not everyone has had the privilege of a good education, so investing in people, training them to be an asset to the business, giving people from deprived areas a lifeline - a chance - you could find that in doing so the business is enriched by all those life experiences.

## Women in tech

My employer The Co-op Digital has taken a defiant stance for women in tech, refusing to speak at events or be part of panel discussions of two or more people unless there is <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2016/07/26/gender-diversity-at-conferences-events/">at least one woman speaking or part of the panel.</a>

I'm proud that the Co-op is taking diversity seriously and I'm sure they will do more in the future and hopefully other businesses will follow suite.

Thats all for now, if you think I've used the word 'different' a lot it's intentional, being different is good so lets celebrate it! Anyway I've got to get back to The Walking Dead, adios for now.
