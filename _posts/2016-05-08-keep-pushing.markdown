Keep pushing, keep pushing, it’s the last mile, I’ve ran well up to now and I’m gaining momentum, just another minute and I can rest.

I have a fascination with running, it’s the simplest form of showing me you get what you put into something, the harder you work, the more runs you do, the better/faster more experience you get.  This I believe rings true in all walks of life and I find it rewarding to see gradual improvements over time from running more frequently.

## Running helps me with work

I also find running helps me with my work, when I’m pushing myself on the road, getting out of my comfort zone by putting some hard honest miles in, it encourages me to push myself in other areas of my life but in the same vein.

It’s not just all hard work though, it can be fun, I sometimes go to my local running club (<a href="http://www.dragonsrunningsale.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sale Dragons</a>) to run out with them, it’s a fantastic club with all levels of runners.  You’d be surprised how having a chat with someone over a 6 mile run can completely take your mind off how tough it is, I recommend trying out your local running club, your running will improve and you’ll meet like minded people.

Feeling fitter and healthier from running are other obvious benefits but it makes you feel better about yourself, I’ve never once regretted doing a run.

## Setting goals

It also helps with setting goals, last year I decided that I wanted to run the <a href="http://www.greatermanchestermarathon.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Marathon</a> in under 3hours 45mins, I stuck to a training plan and achieved my goal (3hours 41min), this again was done with honest hard graft.

And finally getting out for a run is free, so no excuses, what are you waiting for? Keep moving forward.
