With my latest website update comes great responsibility, giving back more to the design community, <!--more-->I need to write about stuff more.



I don’t know about you but I don’t feel at my most creative when writing in ‘word’ or ‘google docs’, for me, like in my workflow for design and development, I need to be organised or it can end in tears…

That's where [Ulysses](https://www.ulyssesapp.com) comes in. Ulysses is a writing app for the mac and iOS which gives you the freedom to write and organise you blogs, articles, notes to your heart's content.  But there's more, it lets you write in ‘markdown’ which is specifically ace for me as my website is built with Jekyll so it plays really nicely with Ulysses.

So for a heading you can just put:
 # My Heading and it will convert into a h1 tag in html when the markdown is compiled to html.

There's loads of other benefits with Ulysses, it's got a clean and simple interface which lets you focus on your writing and set goals with your writing, have a look at the website for a full list of benefits.

I've really enjoyed writing more recently, I feel it helps my creativity and I would encourage more designers to do it.
