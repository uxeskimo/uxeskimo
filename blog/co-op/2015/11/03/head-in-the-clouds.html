Well that was me – literally – yesterday. </p> <p>I work as a Interaction designer/developer at the Co-operative in a growing Digital team based on the 11th floor of 1 Angel Square and while the rest of Manchester struggled with the gloom of the fog, we were almost illuminated by it.</p> <p>I’ve only been with the Co-op for a month or so and am still amazed by my workplace – this unique and innovative building feels like the right place to be as we continue our digital transformation.</p> <p><img src="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/angel-square.jpg" alt="Angel Square"/></p> <p>To say it is exciting times at the moment may be understating it and to not just work for the Co-op but be a part of it as a member adds an extra dimension. I’m not just working for the company; I’m working for the members – you, me and everyone that has joined this historic establishment on the way.</p> <h2 id="a-fantastic-employer">A fantastic employer</h2> <p>In Manchester the Co-op has always had a fantastic reputation as an employer and as one of its newest employees I can vouch for it – the people are welcoming, loyal – working hard and always wanting to be the best.</p> <p>My workplace environment, the equipment, (for starters on my first day a brand spanking new Mac Book Pro was waiting for me), tools to help me ‘do a better job’ never mind the ‘little things’ that make coming to work that little bit easier, it’s clear for me to see that the Co-op puts it’s staff at the heart of who it is and what it wants to be and who wouldn’t want to be part of that.</p> <p><img src="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/nux.jpg" alt="NUX Event"/></p> <p>The history that surrounds the Co-op means that I’m proud to say that I work for them and even prouder and more excited to be part of its future.</p> <h2 id="oh-and-a-little-bit-about-me">Oh and a little bit about me…</h2> <p>I have a passion for designing and developing websites. I’ve done this professionally for the last 15 years, cutting my teeth working for fast paced design agencies after starting off self employed to build my portfolio.</p> <p>Along the way I’ve designed some big sites, the Citizens Advice and Advice Guide websites for example; I transformed the checkouts and subsequent conversion rates for N Brown’s group of e-commerce fashion brands by turning a 10 step multi page process into a 1 page responsive checkout.</p> <p>Almost without realising it I transformed from a website designer to a designer that codes in the browser and right now, here at the Co-op, it feels like this could be my greatest challenge but I know we’ll achieve all we set out to do together.</p> <h2 id="anything-could-happen">Anything could happen</h2> <p>So – back to having my head in the clouds – it feels like anything could happen and any idea could be the one that really changes, improves and moves the Co-op to its next phase – I can’t wait to be part of it – what about you?</p> <p>I’ll be writing regular blogs about UI design/development and my Co-op journey, find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a>.</p> <p><strong>Work hard, have fun, make a difference… Join us at Angel Square…</strong></p> </article> </section> </div> </div> </div> </main> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="row"> <div class="column medium-6"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="07545351167">07545351167</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:uxeskimo@gmail.com">uxeskimo@gmail.com</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a></li> </ul> <p>A mancunian production, copyright © 2017 Lee Murray</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/scripts/script.js"></script> </body> </html>
