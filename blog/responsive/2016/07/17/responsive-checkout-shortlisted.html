The checkout for N Brown Group has been a resounding success since it’s implementation in late 2014.</p> <h2 id="increases-in-conversion">Increases in conversion</h2> <p>Increases in checkout conversion for desktops by 18%, tablets by 14%, and smartphones by 9% tell a story of a checkout being made easier for the user to complete their purchase.</p> <p>Looking back there were indicators as to why it worked so well; from day 1 we ticked a lot of the boxes in how we planned and approached the project.</p> <h2 id="observed-users">Observed users</h2> <p>First off we looked at the existing checkout, we got real users to look at it, observed them, spoke with them to help define the problems.</p> <p>We monitored the stats and held lots of workshops to piece together the problems we were trying to solve, we even had a look around to see what competitors were doing.</p> <p>It was a little bit daunting at times as we were working to an inflexible deadline and were told it would cost the business thousands if we didn’t meet it.</p> <p>There were other issues as well in terms of the constraints and limitations of the current backend system that the checkout would be intertwined with, unfortunately we couldn’t create a new checkout from scratch.</p> <h2 id="diverse-team">Diverse team</h2> <p>We had a small diverse team of talented passionate individuals who all had the same end goal in mind - make it work.</p> <p>Diversity is a great thing to have on teams; people from different backgrounds bring different things to the table.</p> <p>I didn’t take the usual root to a degree - Grammar school, A-levels University at 18 - I left school at 16 and needed to get work to pay bills.</p> <p>I returned to education in my early 20’s when I could afford it, and as websites really began to take off, knowing what I wanted to do.</p> <h2 id="prototypes">Prototypes</h2> <p>Going back to the checkout, once we felt we were clear on what problems we were trying to solve, designs and prototypes were created.</p> <p>We sketched out pages and then got something straight into the browser. We tested them as we went along on all formats - mobile, tablet and desktop.</p> <p>We went through a few iterations like this getting feedback from real users helping us make the html prototypes better with each version.</p> <h2 id="ready-to-launch">Ready to launch</h2> <p>As the users scrutinised every aspect of the checkout design iteration, by the time we were ready to launch we were actually really confident that we were improving what we had; we just didn’t realise how much we had improved it!</p> <p>So it’s nice and I feel proud that I contributed to the checkout that has been shortlisted for an award - <strong>but I’m even prouder that users found the checkout so much easier to use</strong>.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://techecommawards.retail-week.com/shortlist-2016" target="_blank">The shortlist for digital customer experience of the year 2016:</a></strong></p> <ul class="highlight"> <li>Argos with 24/7 Customer Inc, Predictive Sales Chat</li> <li>Asda, Automated Collection Point</li> <li>Cycle Republic with Yocuda, Cycle Republic Reward Card</li> <li>John Lewis, #BreakingPad</li> <li>LloydsPharmacy Online, Online Doctor Service</li> <li>Marks &amp; Spencer with Smartzer, Shoppable Videos</li> <li><strong>N Brown Group, One Page Checkout</strong></li> <li>Shop Direct with RichRelevance, Personalisation at the Core</li> <li>Tesco with IFTTT</li> <li>The Book People with RichRelevance, Personalising More Than Just Product</li> </ul> </article> <div class="page-navigation"> <a class="prev" href="/blog/running/2016/05/08/keep-pushing.html">&laquo; Keep pushing, keep pushing</a> <a class="next" href="/blog/teamwork/2017/03/11/diversity-in-the-waking-dead.html">Diversity in the walking dead &raquo;</a> </div> </section> </div> </div> </div> </main> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="row"> <div class="column medium-6"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="07545351167">07545351167</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:uxeskimo@gmail.com">uxeskimo@gmail.com</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a></li> </ul> <p>A mancunian production, copyright © 2017 Lee Murray</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/scripts/script.js"></script> </body> </html>
