I’ve been assisted with volunteers from the library to help with admin and fixing PC problems which I’m really grateful for.</p> <h2 id="scratch">Scratch</h2> <p>I’ve started off using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> with the group, Scratch is a graphical programming language, its often referred to as the programming equivalent of lego. It’s great as you can drag and drop code blocks to create animation and games and lots of other programs. The first week we completed the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26741186/#editor">‘Rock band’</a> project, have a look at it to get an idea of how Scratch works.</p> <h2 id="edith">Edith</h2> <p>My daughter Edith has got a place at the group, she was already really good at scratch and has given me plenty of tips. We’ve started prepping together for each session which is fun and she also keeps me in check!</p> <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/edith-code-club.jpg" alt="Scratch book"/></p> <h2 id="html--css">HTML &amp; CSS</h2> <p>I plan to move onto HTML &amp; CSS after the scratch modules. The children and parents have expressed a keen interest in this so I’m looking forward to it. I’ve been told other clubs find it difficult to teach the HTML &amp; CSS - stuff that I’m more familiar with so my experience will help out here.</p> <p>To see the kids genuinely interested in designing websites really took me by surprise so I’ll do what I can to help.</p> <h2 id="planning-ahead">Planning ahead</h2> <p>As mentioned before I’ve started doing my preps for the sessions with Edith. I’ve found its essential to go through the module yourself beforehand. In this way I can anticipate what problems the kids might encounter.</p> <p>Being brutality honest, being organised has traditionally not been one of my best traits and not wanting to make an ass of myself in front of the children and their parents has required me to try and improve in this area.</p> <p>Balancing family and work life has always been a challenge but it shouldn’t be. As I’ve got older you realise that prep is the key, I use the app ‘Things’ to manage tasks. They’ve done an update to <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things (version 3)</a> last week and its awesome (winning combination alongside <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> for archiving notes).</p> <h2 id="get-involved">Get involved</h2> <p>Why not get involved? So far for me this has been rewarding, it’s forcing me out of my comfort zone and, in doing so, helping me improve myself by helping others.</p> <p>Have a look on the code club website for <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/find-a-club">clubs near to you</a>.</p> <p>Adios for now, Lee.</p> </article> </section> </div> </div> </div> </main> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="row"> <div class="column medium-6"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="07545351167">07545351167</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:uxeskimo@gmail.com">uxeskimo@gmail.com</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a></li> </ul> <p>A mancunian production, copyright © 2017 Lee Murray</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/scripts/script.js"></script> </body> </html>
