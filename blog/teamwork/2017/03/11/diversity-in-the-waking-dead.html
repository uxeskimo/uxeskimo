What I’ve really been impressed with though is the diversity of the cast, it discriminates no one and it has set a standard other TV shows should follow.</p> <h2 id="minorities">Minorities</h2> <p>We have lead women, ethnic minorities, all types of relationships, which don’t follow common stereotypes, they all stand on their own merits and I’m sure the diverse group have been a big factor in the shows box office success.</p> <p>The team have worked together to help each other survive this ruthless new word they have found themselves living in and I can’t help thinking putting this non-fictional TV show aside how the best teams I have worked in have been diverse - different people from different backgrounds with different personalities, strengths and weaknesses.</p> <h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2> <p>Research backs diversity in teams but from my own experiences at the simplest level, it can help a group look at things from a different perspective.</p> <ul class="highlight"> <li>"A 2015 McKinsey report on 366 public companies found that those in the top quartile for ethnic and racial diversity in management were 35% more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, and those in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely to have returns above the industry mean." <span class="author-citation">David Rock and Heidi Grant <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter</a></span></li> </ul> <p>If businesses are looking for talent, people come to their talents in different ways. Not everyone has had the privilege of a good education, so investing in people, training them to be an asset to the business, giving people from deprived areas a lifeline - a chance - you could find that in doing so the business is enriched by all those life experiences.</p> <h2 id="women-in-tech">Women in tech</h2> <p>My employer The Co-op Digital has taken a defiant stance for women in tech, refusing to speak at events or be part of panel discussions of two or more people unless there is <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2016/07/26/gender-diversity-at-conferences-events/">at least one woman speaking or part of the panel.</a></p> <p>I’m proud that the Co-op is taking diversity seriously and I’m sure they will do more in the future and hopefully other businesses will follow suite.</p> <p>Thats all for now, if you think I’ve used the word ‘different’ a lot it’s intentional, being different is good so lets celebrate it! Anyway I’ve got to get back to The Walking Dead, adios for now.</p> </article> </section> </div> </div> </div> </main> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="row"> <div class="column medium-6"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="07545351167">07545351167</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:uxeskimo@gmail.com">uxeskimo@gmail.com</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a></li> </ul> <p>A mancunian production, copyright © 2017 Lee Murray</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/scripts/script.js"></script> </body> </html>
