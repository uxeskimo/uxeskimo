As soon as I found out we were looking for people from within my organisation to push diversity, I knew I wanted to apply.</p> <p>One could say it’s morally and ethically wrong to not try to create a diverse and inclusive organisation, but it’s not just that. Its a proven fact that diverse teams are the most effective; it doesn’t just look good on paper but being more diverse will help the business in building and providing better products and services.</p> <p>We’re getting better at tackling gender issues in IT but we need to do more and start to make in roads in other areas as well, race, age, religious background, sexual orientation, disability, nationality and an area I’ve been thinking a lot about lately, socioeconomic background.</p> <h2 id="working-class">Working class</h2> <p>I’m from a working class back ground and was brought up in some of the finest council estates in Manchester; something I won’t shy away from, something I’m very proud of and perhaps not something I see so frequently in the IT world I work in.</p> <p>I spent some time with the legendary Jimmy Egan as a teenager boxing out of his Benchill club in Wythenshawe - this really was the school of hard knocks! Boxing helped me understand from an early age if you want success you need to work hard for it and it was an education, lessons I learnt that I feel, has helped me push myself on in life.</p> <p>The late, great, Jimmy Egan was a true inspiration for me and many, many people from Manchester. He was passionate about helping his community, keeping kids off the streets in Wythenshawe council estates, showing them the benefits of hard work, and how it could take you further in life.</p> <h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2> <p>Jimmy knew all about diversity and accepted everyone and anyone - all types of people/cultures - in the gym, nobody was turned away and it was like one big family. The ‘travellers’ community were often in the gym despite bad press, they were never discriminated against by Jimmy and were welcomed.</p> <p>Jimmys’ sons now run his gym, dedicating a large proportion of their lives to help kids from under privileged areas, turning many into champions, in the ring and out of it - truly inspirational people.</p> <h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2> <p>Adding this new aspect or role to my current job at the Co-op, I will be thinking of ideas to try and make us be more diverse and inclusive. I have written this blog with reference to Jimmy Egan’s club and the work they do in their ‘working class’ community and can’t help but reflect back to the working class roots of the Co-op.</p> <p>I’m sure there are many talents in council estates and areas where life does not perhaps give the same chances that some of us get that with a little guidance and opportunity could be inspirational at the Co-op one day.</p> <p>Be yourself always, show you care &amp; succeed together – doing what matters most.</p> <p>Lee.</p> <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/be-yourself-always.jpg" alt="Be yourself always"/></p> </article> </section> </div> </div> </div> </main> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="row"> <div class="column medium-6"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="07545351167">07545351167</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:uxeskimo@gmail.com">uxeskimo@gmail.com</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a></li> </ul> <p>A mancunian production, copyright © 2017 Lee Murray</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/scripts/script.js"></script> </body> </html>
