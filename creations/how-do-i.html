We then launched to more stores in Surrey and Glasgow which brought the number of test stores up to 47.</p> <p>We built in a feedback mechanism on each page of ‘how do i’ that allowed colleagues to send us feedback directly, this proved to be a really useful feature in two ways, one helping us improve the design and content but also it was giving colleagues direct input into how to improve ‘how do i' becoming more involded.</p> <p>We visited the stores to see how they were getting on, mostly the feedback was positive and we continued to listen to our colleagues in store improving and again iterating ‘how do i’. We launched to more stores, including the stores of excellence, the content now was getting more and more substantial.</p> <p>‘How do i’ is now used in all our food stores and we will continue to learn and improve on it to help our food colleagues.</p> </div> </div> </div> </main> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="row"> <div class="column medium-6"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="07545351167">07545351167</a></li> <li><a href="mailto:uxeskimo@gmail.com">uxeskimo@gmail.com</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/uxeskimo">@uxeskimo</a></li> </ul> <p>A mancunian production, copyright © 2017 Lee Murray</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/scripts/script.js"></script> <script>function labnolThumb(e){return'<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eskimo/How-Do-I-Mac.jpg">'.replace("ID",e)+'<div class="play"></div>'}function labnolIframe(){var e=document.createElement("iframe");e.setAttribute("src","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ID?autoplay=1".replace("ID",this.dataset.id)),e.setAttribute("frameborder","0"),e.setAttribute("allowfullscreen","1"),this.parentNode.replaceChild(e,this)}document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){var e,t,a=document.getElementsByClassName("youtube-player");for(t=0;t<a.length;t++)e=document.createElement("div"),e.setAttribute("data-id",a[t].dataset.id),e.innerHTML=labnolThumb(a[t].dataset.id),e.onclick=labnolIframe,a[t].appendChild(e)});</script> </body> </html>
