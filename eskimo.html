<h1>About Lee Murray</h1>

<p>I’ve been a designer now for over 16 years, it’s my job, my passion - a huge part of my life.  I’m armed with the skillsets that a designer requires in 2017 to be effective and make a difference.</p>

<p>I’m a good communicator who encourages collaboration,  experience has taught me being a designer means being a problem solver, an skill that is so much more than creating a nice UI on screen.</p>

<h2>Why eskimo?</h2>

<p>When I was contracting many years ago my company had 'eskimo' in it's name.</p>

<p>I used eskimo as I admired how resourceful an eskimo could be living in freezing temperatures, being resourceful is something I prided myself on.</p>

<p>Eskimo was also a memorable name, I managed to build a client base of nearly 100 clients, so it did well by me!</p>

<p>I've also managed to raise over £20,000 for various charities and local community based clubs in Manchester using the eskimo name, some of these include:</p>
